    ## # ℹ 334 more rows
    ## # ℹ 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>

The data include the species of penguin, the island the penguin comes
from, the penguins’ bill length, bill depth, and flipper length (all
measured in mm), their body mass (measured in g), their sex (male or
female) and the year in which the data point was taken (from 2007 to
2009, inclusive).

The dataset has 344 rows, meaning that there are 344 penguins in the
dataset. It has 8 columns, so there are a total of 8 variables being
measured.

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm, not including penguins for which
the flipper length value is missing.
